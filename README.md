# Structures

This page contains structures build with the **nanocomposite** tool.  There are two files in each directory: a structure file (PSF format) and a coordinate file (PDB format). All MD systems were equilibrated at 300K and 1 atm. pressure.

* 11_PS125_CNT2

  Polystyrene melt composed of 125 polymer chains with two embedded double-walled CNTs.


* 20_PEEK125

  Polyether ether ketone melt composed of 125 polymer chains.


* 21_PEEK125_CNT1

  Polyether ether ketone melt composed of 125 polymer chains with one embedded double-walled CNT. 


* 22_PEEK125_CNT4
