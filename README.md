# Structures

This page contains structures build with the **nanocomposite** tool.  There are two files in each directory: a structure file (PSF format) and a coordinate file (PDB format).

 
* 01_PS125_CNT2

  Equilibrated structures for polystyrene melt composed of 125 polymer chains.   The polymer melt contains two embedded double-walled CNTs. The MD equilibrations were performed at 300K and 1 atm. pressure

* 02_PEEK125_CNT1

  Equilibrated structures for polyether ether ketone melt composed of 125 polymer chains.   The polymer melt contains one embedded double-walled CNT. The MD equilibrations were performed at 300K and 1 atm. pressure
 
 
* 03_PEEK125_CNT4

  Equilibrated structures for polyether ether ketone melt composed of 125 polymer chains.   The polymer melt contains four embedded double-walled CNTs. The MD equilibrations were performed at 300K and 1 atm. pressure


* 04_PEEK125_CNT6

  Equilibrated structures for polyether ether ketone melt composed of 125 polymer chains.   The polymer melt contains six embedded double-walled CNTs. The MD equilibrations were performed at 300K and 1 atm. pressure
