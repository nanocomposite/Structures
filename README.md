# Structures

This page contains structures build with the **nanocomposite** tool.  There are two files in each directory: a structure file (PSF format) and a coordinate file (PDB format). All structures were equilibrated at 300K and 1 atm.  Force field parameters to perform MD simulations are available in the following [link](https://github.com/nanocomposite/Parameters).



The structures are free to use, our only request is to acknowledge the following publication:
